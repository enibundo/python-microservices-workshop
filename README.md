# python-microservices-workshop

This repository contains the content for my intervention as a lecturer in Microservices implementation in Python in a French ecole.

The aim of this course is to teach to Master 2 students:

- how to set up a python environment
- how to write services
- how to make servicies communicate with each other
- how to dockerize and run the whole architecture locally
- how to write end to end tests to ensure that it all works correctly
